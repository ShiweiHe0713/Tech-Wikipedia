# OpenAI Assistant
[Assistnats API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?lang=python)

- What is Assistants API?
The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications.

- What is a Thread?
"Create a Thread when a user starts a conversation." I think it's sorta like the thread in Reddit, a thread is a conversation consists of a series of question and answers. The `Messages` is the users' questions.

- Typical integration of Assistants API flow:
1. Create an Assistant
2. Create a Thread
3. Add a Message to the thread
4. Run the assistant on the thread
